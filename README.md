A browser extension that automatically calculates and displays an author‚Äôs self-citation rate directly on their Google Scholar profile page, **now with a hybrid DBLP + OpenAlex backend to support all academic disciplines.**

## The Problem ü§î

Google Scholar is an invaluable tool for academics, but its headline metrics do not distinguish between **external citations** and **self-citations**. A high citation count can therefore be misleading if a large fraction comes from the author‚Äôs own work.
This extension adds that missing dimension at a glance, promoting a more transparent and nuanced understanding of scholarly impact.

## Key Features üöÄ

- **Hybrid Data Sources** ‚Äì Prioritizes the high-quality **DBLP** dataset for Computer Science, and automatically **falls back to the comprehensive OpenAlex database** for all other disciplines.
- **Seamless Integration** ‚Äì Injects a **Self-Citation Rate** panel directly into the statistics table on Google Scholar author pages.
- **Dynamic & Detailed Tooltip** ‚Äì Hover over the **?** icon to see the definition of a self-citation, a disclaimer, and the **specific data source (DBLP or OpenAlex) used for the calculation**.
- **Smart Author Matching** ‚Äì A robust heuristic algorithm (Jaro-Winkler similarity + publication overlap) finds the correct author profile on both DBLP and OpenAlex.
- **On-Demand Refresh** ‚Äì A one-click **Refresh** button clears the cache and recalculates the metric.
- **30-Day Caching** ‚Äì Results are cached locally for 30 days to provide instant results and minimize API calls.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

The extension uses a tiered, fallback data strategy:

1.  **UI Injection (`content.ts`)**
    - When you open a Google Scholar author page, the content script grabs the author‚Äôs name and their first 10 publication titles.
    - It immediately injects a *"Calculating..."* status panel into the statistics area.

2.  **Tier 1: DBLP Search (`background.ts`)**
    - The script first attempts to find a matching author profile on DBLP using the smart author-matching heuristic.
    - If a confident match is found, it proceeds to analyze citations using the **DBLP + OpenCitations SPARQL endpoint**.
    - **Citation Model:** DBLP results are based on **unique citing articles** (the standard academic definition).

3.  **Tier 2: OpenAlex Fallback (`background.ts`)**
    - If no confident match is found on DBLP (common for non-CS/EE fields), the extension **automatically and seamlessly switches to OpenAlex**.
    - It runs the same smart author-matching heuristic against the OpenAlex API.
    - If a match is found, it proceeds with a detailed citation analysis.
    - **Citation Model:** OpenAlex results are based on **total citation mentions** (non-unique, a paper citing 3 works counts as 3 citations). This method is used to accommodate API limitations for anonymous users.

4.  **Displaying Results (`content.ts`)**
    - The background script returns the calculated data, regardless of the source.
    - The content script replaces the "Calculating..." panel with the final percentage.
    - The tooltip text is **dynamically updated** to reflect whether the data came from DBLP or OpenAlex and to explain the relevant citation model used.

## Disclaimer üìù

* The citation data is sourced from DBLP-OpenCitations and OpenAlex. These datasets are invaluable, but their **coverage may not be 100% complete or perfectly up-to-date**.
* The author-matching heuristic is designed to be accurate but may occasionally fail to find the correct profile or select an incorrect one for authors with common names.
* This tool is intended for informational purposes and should be used as a supplementary metric, not as a definitive measure of scholarly integrity or impact.
